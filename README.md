# 100 Days CSS

My attempt at recreating some of the [100 Days CSS](https://100dayscss.com) frames, with some extra features.

All of these are:
- **Made responsive**. If you change the size of the frame, the image should resize accordingly, nothing is a fixed size. For example with "095 pig drawing", if you set the frame width to half the size, the image will shrink horizontally by half.

- **Utilize CSS custom properties (variables) for easy changes to various aspects of each frame**. For example with 097 person, you can change the value of the "person-height" variable and the person will change to that height while still being centered in the frame.
