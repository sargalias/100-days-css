# 100 Days CSS

My attempt at recreating some of the [100 Days CSS](https://100dayscss.com) frames, with some extra features.

## Commands

`npm start` - Runs the project on a local server for development.

`npm run build` - Build the project for uploading to a server.

## Features

- **Responsiveness**: I tried to make these as responsive as possible. For some of them, if you change the size of the frame the image should resize accordingly. E.g. with "095 pig drawing". However for some things like text and borders I had to use absolute sizes, so those things are not fully responsive.

- **Custom properties or Sass variables for easy changes to various aspects of each frame**. For example with 097 person, you can change the value of the "person-height" variable and the person will change to that height while still being centered in the frame.
